# Decision Tree
[sample code](./decision_tree.py)

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.  
Decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules.  
The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node has two or more branches
